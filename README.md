# cycle-iso
A simple isomorphic cycle app starter

This is a very basic setup for an isomorphic [Cycle.js](http://cycle.js.org/) framework, it does not encompass the [MVI](http://cycle.js.org/model-view-intent.html) (Model, View, Intent) as to keep it as basic, cleaner, declarative and has bare minimum setting to run.

This app use webpack and babel as part of the build process.

## New Stuff

Update to use Cycle.js/xstream from diversity branch

## How to extend this?

- For complex routing you can start looking into [switchPath](https://github.com/staltz/switch-path), 
- For drivers you can start [here](http://cycle.js.org/drivers.html)
- For everything awesome about cycle.js go [here](https://github.com/vic/awesome-cyclejs)
